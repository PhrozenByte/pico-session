Pico Session
============

This is the repository of Pico's official session plugin.

Pico is a stupidly simple, blazing fast, flat file CMS. See http://picocms.org/ for more info.

**WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT YET USABLE**  
This is a development preview. It isn't ready for testing by non-developers, far less from ready for production use!

Install
-------

Just [download the latest release](https://github.com/PhrozenByte/pico-session/releases/latest) and upload the `PicoSession` directory to the `plugins` directory of your Pico installation (e.g. `/var/www/html/pico/plugins/`). The plugin is also available on [Packagist.org](https://packagist.org/packages/phrozenbyte/pico-session) and may be included in other projects via `composer require phrozenbyte/pico-session`. The plugin requires Pico 2.0+

Config
------

You can't configure this plugin, it's a utility plugin for plugin developers.
